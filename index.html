            <p>This is my first semester at IIT and I'm thrilled to be part of this class! My journey into web
                development
                began
                in my under-graduation. From there, I delved deeper into the realm of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                discovering the
                magic of turning code into captivating web experiences. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work
                on
                various web projects, ranging from personal blogs to dynamic web applications. Each project has been a
                learning
                adventure, allowing me to refine my skills and explore new technologies along the way. I completed my
                under-graduation in 2022 and I worked as a Software Developer at NCR for 1 and half year. I'm excited to
                learn
                from each of you and explore the endless possibilities that the world of web development has to offer.
                Let's
                inspire, innovate, and build something extraordinary together! </p>
